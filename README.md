# R activities for the Evolution of Earth Systems course
These files to aid the R modeling component of the Earth System Evolution course -- Stanford Univ. 2019

## Lecture 0: Intro to R - Tutorial
This is the "Intro to R - Tutorial.Rmd" file. Before opening in RStudio, make sure you have installed the packages:

1. ggplot2
2. learnr
3. tidyverse

Then, open the file in RStudio and click "Run Document" (next to the green arrow right above the script). 

A window should open labeled RStudio at the top of the page. This window contains an interactive tutorial for you to follow. It covers the basics--meant for brand-new beginners to R. There is no quiz and you will not be graded on your performance.

## Lecture 1: Steady state C-cycle box model
This tutorial walks through how to write a simple function in R for the steady state, long-term Carbon cycle. We will eventually derive the transient (time-dependent) solution to this model following the framework of Kump and Arthur, 1999. 

For today, we will not consider the isotopic signatures of these various fluxes and instead focus on the balance of the fluxes themselves.
