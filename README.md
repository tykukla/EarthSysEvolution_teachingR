## Lecture 1: Intro to R - Tutorial
This is the "Intro to R - Tutorial.Rmd" file. Before opening in RStudio, make sure you have installed the packages:

1. ggplot2
2. learnr
3. tidyverse

Then, open the file in RStudio and click "Run Document" (next to the green arrow right above the script). 

A window should open labeled RStudio at the top of the page. This window contains an interactive tutorial for you to follow. It covers the basics--meant for brand-new beginners to R. There is no quiz and you will not be graded on your performance.
